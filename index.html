            <h2>History of the Android Mascot</h2>
            <p>
                You probably know that the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.android.com/\">Android</a> operating system, maintained by <strong>Google</strong>, is one of the most widely used for mobile devices worldwide. But maybe you don't know that its friendly mascot has a name and a very curious history? So, follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.
            </p>
        </article>
    
        <h3>The First Version</h3>
    
        <p>
            The first attempt to create a mascot emerged in 2007 and came from a developer named <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" rel="external" target="_blank">Dan Morrill</a>. He explains that he opened <a href="https://inkscape.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">Inkscape</a> (a free vector graphics software) and created his own version of a robot. The goal was merely to personify the system for his team; there was no request from the company for the creation of a mascot.

        <p>
            This first bizarre version was even named after its creator: the Dandroids.
        </p>
        <h3>A new mascot emerges</h3>
        <p>
            The idea of having a mascot evolved, and the task was handed over to a professional in the field. Russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">Irina Blok</a>, also an employee of Google, was given the mission to represent the little robot in a more appealing way.
        </p>

            <source media="(max-width: 850px)" srcset="image/irina-blok-pq.jpg" type="image/jpeg">
            <img src="image/irina-blok.jpg" alt="irina blok" class="image-full">
        </picture>
    
        <p>
            Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few lines and in a more flat style. The design should also allow for quick recognition by those who see it. Thus, the Bugdroid emerged, the new mascot of Android.
        </p>
        
        <img src="image/bugdroid.png" alt="bugdroid" class="image-center">
    
        <p>
            The main inspiration for the lines of the new Bugdroid came from those little figures that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate gender. Legend has it that the artist was working at her desk at Google and glanced at the bathroom signs, and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, and to the point.

                Another interesting fact about Android is that each version has always been named after a dessert, in alphabetical order from version 1.5 up to 9.0.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>1.5 - Cupcake</li>
                <li>1.6 - Donut</li>
                <li>3.0 - Eclair</li>
                <li>2.2 - Froyo</li>
                <li>2.3 - Gingerbread</li>
                <li>3.0 - Honeycomb</li>
                <li>4.0 - Ice Cream Sandwich</li>
                <li>4.1 - Jelly Bean</li>
                <li>4.4 - KitKat</li>
                <li>5.0 - Lolipop</li>
                <li>6.0 - Marshmallow</li>
                <li>7.0 - Nougat</li>
                <li>8.0 - Oreo</li>
                <li>9.0 - Pie</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, Android Q did not exist, as Google decided to end this fun practice and began using numerical versions, which led to Android 10.
